# Overview #

This is a start of a collection of firmware for BBC [micro:bit](https://www.microbit.org/new-microbit/) board.

The hardware is much improved in version 2, and with the built-in speaker, the microphone and some random-acces memory we'll start with building a parrot, naturally.

## The Parrot ##

[The Parrot](/Parrot) can blink, listen and record about a second of audio, and then repeat the sound one to five times

* Be a soul of a (kids') party
